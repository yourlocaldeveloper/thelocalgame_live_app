This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project. Linking to both the Stream Overlay FE and Express App BE. These can be found [here](https://github.com/yourlocaldeveloper/thelocalgame)


# thelocalgame_live_app

This is the heart of the RFID table. This handles the entire logic and game flow. This is a React Native app that utilizes Socket.io and RESTful APIs to control the stream output.

This handles the game logic and stores the state it is in.

## Notible files:

[HandProgress.tsx](https://github.com/yourlocaldeveloper/thelocalgame_live_app/blob/develop/components/molecules/HandProgress/HandProgress.tsx)

This is one of the most important files in the app. It is a component that handles user input to handle the game. This is a very messy file. I am currently trying to trim it down and refactor it. I've moved a bunch of functions into the [helper file](https://github.com/yourlocaldeveloper/thelocalgame_live_app/blob/develop/components/molecules/HandProgress/HandProgress.helpers.ts) to improve the code splitting.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
